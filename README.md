# Singularity

Snippet manager for Singular.live

Using [wxt.dev](https://wxt.dev) for easy browser vendoring and [sucrase](https://github.com/alangpierce/sucrase) for quick typescript transpilation.

### Roadmap

- add search menu in popup
- add quick-add from clipboard
- ~~cache html from shiki by snippet id/code~~ big memory imprint for minro gains
- ~~Twoslash / monaco~~ heavy bundle, but could replace `sucrase`
